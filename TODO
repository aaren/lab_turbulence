### Things to do  ###

- Non dimensionalise everything

- Theory
    - turbulent shear layer at top
    - compare to log flow at bottom

- Abstract plotting of simple axes to a single function with arguments
  that are looked up in a dictionary of default plots.


Following 19/7/13 meeting:

- Power Spectra
    - Pick distinct domains to analyse

- DMD
    - apply to front relative field

- Wavelets
    - Heaviside function
    - bug check scipy.signal.morlet
    - High pass filter to remove head region
    - average over domain

- Distributions (generalise to any quantity input)
    - shear
    - vorticity

- Extrema
    - Plot distribution of e.g. 95th percentile velocity over domain

- Scale analysis
    - What is shear when computed with larger dz?
