Aim: Complete tasks from last supervision

Things to do:

- [x] fit straight line / smooth front detection
- [ ] check sensitivity of stats to different fittings

- [x] overlay multiple runs to get first impression of similarity
  (use the single height over time)

- [x] do the front relative transform along the other (space) axis
  and see what it looks like

- [ ] can we identify qualitatively different regions of the flow?
- [ ] do they have distinct pdfs?
- [ ] does cantero have something to say here?

- [ ] DMD: can we recompose the flow from low order modes?

- [ ] look at streamwise velocity
- [ ] subtract front speed to get front relative velocity
- [ ] is there a region of the flow in which the decomp mean front
  relative velocity is zero? (is this the region of statistical
  stationarity?)
