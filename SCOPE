Do one thing and do it well.

The thing here is data import.

The thing being imported is lots of csv / tsv files that are output
by Dynamic Studio.

The format I want to store them in is .npz, numpy native format.

This is like the current setup but with caching turned on always.


# instantiate a run
r = SingleLayerRun(some_metadata)

# load all of the files and save as a .npz
# will overwrite cache if it exists?
r.import_all()

# safer to have a specific reload command
r.reload()
# or
r.import_all(reload=True)

# load from the cache
r.load()

# access data in the run
r.u, r.v, r.w, ...
